Asynchronous Fortran (threads) README file

This software package brings portable threads to Fortran projects.
It is e.g. being used from the [Sea-ice Ocean Model (FESOM)](http://fesom.de) of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI).

Any feedback is greatly appreciated, please mail to: Jan Hegewald <jan.hegewald@awi.de>
